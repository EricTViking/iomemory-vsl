# IOMemory-VSL
This is an unsupported update of the original driver source for FusionIO
cards. It comes with no warranty, it may cause DATA LOSS or CORRUPTION.

# IOMemory-VSL4
For the iomemory-vsl4 driver please go to the [iomemory-vsl4](https://github.com/snuf/iomemory-vsl4) repo.

## Background
Driver support for FusionIO cards has been lagging behind kernel releases, effectively making these cards an expensive paperweight when running a distribution like Ubuntu / Arch / Fedora / ProxMox which all supply newer kernels than supported by the original drivers.

## Releases
Releases are tagged, and should be checked out by their tag. The release tags follow Linux Kernel versions. E.g. **v5.12.0 (A Fine Boi)** will work on all 5.x kernels that are 5.12 and lower, but is not guaranteed to work on 5.13. **v4.20.0 - Grey Dawn** supports most kernels that pre-date 5.0.

| Tag | Codename |
| --- | --- |
| v5.12.0 | [A Fine Boi](https://i.imgur.com/SrtYVIr.jpeg) |
| v5.10.0 | [Fatto Catto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S69FTdTS8g) |
| v5.6.0 | [MEGACHONKER](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chonkers/) |
| v4.20.1 | [Grey Dawn](https://southpark.cc.com/clips/154175/crazy-old-drivers) |

## Versions
The driver is derived from the original iomemory-vsl-3.2.16, but has several fixes and gone through rigorous cleaning of redundant unused and old code. Active development is done on master, while *tags* are used for releases. The new releases are all tagged from master, whereas the v4.20 releases are tagged from fio-3.2.16.1732, which is a modified version of the original codebase.

The modified source fixes several known bugs in the driver:
- silent IO drops
- crashes during driver unload
- SCSI queue settings
- BIO status handling

## Important note!!!
Commits to master are not "always" write tested, just compile tested. Releases have gone through testing with Flexible I/O Tester. Testing for page_cache errors, and generic FIO checksumming on read and write and different block sizes. Non released branches are often in process of verification and under active development.

## Building
### Source
```
git clone https://github.com/snuf/iomemory-vsl
cd iomemory-vsl/
git checkout <release-tag>
make module
sudo insmod root/usr/src/iomemory-vsl-3.2.16/iomemory-vsl.ko
```
### .deb Ubuntu / Debian
```
git clone https://github.com/snuf/iomemory-vsl
cd iomemory-vsl
git checkout <release-tag>
make dpkg
```

### .rpm CentOS / RHEL
```
git clone https://github.com/snuf/iomemory-vsl
cd iomemory-vsl/
git checkout <release-tag>
make rpm
```

## Installation
DKMS is recommended, but installation can also be done with the created packages.

## DKMS
Dynamic Kernel Module Support automates away the requirement of having to repackage the kernel module with every kernel and headers update that takes place on the system. This mechanism also makes sure that the driver for the new kernel actually works, or if the source needs refreshing.
```
git clone https://github.com/snuf/iomemory-vsl
cd iomemory-vsl/
git checkout <release-tag>
make dkms
```

# Utils
With fio-utils installed and passing a single device through to a VM you should see someting similair to the following...:

# Acknowledgements
The support and maintenance of this driver is made possible by the people that actively contribute or contributed to its code base or by supporting the project in other ways.

| Name | Discord |  |
|---|---|---|
| Demetrius Cassidy | @Tourman | Long nights of cleaning the codebase, setting up the Discord channel and guiding people through firmware upgrades |
| Vince Fleming |  | Donating a 1.2TB IoDrive2 for debugging problems |

Obviously all the regulars on the Discord channel, notably @bplein, @AcquaCow and @Tear.

Oh yes and the folks that were at <b>Fusion IO</b> for creating this product that was way ahead of its time and delivering the integration shim sources with the driver core.

## Notes
Installing the fio-util, fio-common, fio-preinstall and fio-sysvinit are recommended.
When moving from source 2.3.11 to source 3.2.10 the firmware HAS TO BE UPDATED to 3.2.10.20150212. For the move to 3.2.15, and 3.2.16 from 3.2.10 we've not seen any issues.

## Firmware
Though the newer the firmware often the better. If your card is not supported with the latest firmware drop by the Discord channel and someone might be able to help you.
