# IOMemory-VSL

This is an unsoported shameless rip and update of the original source 
for FusionIO cards. It comes with no waranty, just the "works on my desktop"
one. So if you use this and lose data, tough luck...  I myself only use 
it for data that is also stored elsewhere and for experimentation purposes.

## Background
As driver support was seriously lacking for newer kernels it seemed like
a trivial task to port the drivers to newer versions. Code thus far
has been based on:
    2.3.11.183
    3.2.10.1509

Kernels it has worked with: 2.3.11, 3.2.10, 3.19, 3.8.0, 4.2.0

## Install
Only the version branches are supported, nothing else, it might work
on newer versions, or older versions, close to the branch, but again
no guarantees there.
