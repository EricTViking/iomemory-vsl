1.a.i.1.3. Third Party Software.   The Software may contain or be distributed with third party software covered by an open source software license (“Open Source Software”) or other third party software (“Third Party Software”), which may be covered by a different license.  If Open Source Software is included, the terms and conditions of this license do not apply to the Open Source Software.  If Third Party Software is included, the terms and conditions of this license may not apply to Third Party Software.  Information concerning the inclusion of Open Source Software and Third Party Software, if any, and the notices, license terms, and disclaimers applicable to that software are generally contained in a corresponding license file identified with file names such as “notice,” “license,” “license.txt,” “readme,” “readme.txt,” or “copying”; you should contact Fusion-io support if you cannot find any Open Source Software or Third Party Software license.  If the Open Source Software licenses include a license that provides for the availability of source code (e.g., the GNU General Public License) and the corresponding source code is not included with the Software, check Fusion-io’s product support pages to learn how to obtain such source code.

1.a.i.1.4. Reservation of Rights.  The license granted to you in Section 1 is not a transfer or sale of Fusion-io’s or its suppliers’ ownership rights in or to the Software.  Except for the license granted in Section 1, Fusion-io and its suppliers retain all right, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to the Software.  The Software is protected by applicable intellectual property laws, including United States patent and copyright laws and international property laws and treaties.  Fusion-io and its suppliers reserve all rights not expressly granted to you in this EULA.

1.a.i.1.5. Limited Warranty and Disclaimer.  Fusion-io warrants that, for a period of 90 days from the date the Software is first installed, when used with a recommended hardware configuration, the Software will perform in substantial conformance with the documentation supplied with the Software.  EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THE FOREGOING LIMITED WARRANTY, FUSIONIO AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUALITY, ACCURACY, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. FUSIONIO DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE IS ERROR-FREE OR THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION.

FUSIONIO SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR SUCH PURPOSES.

1.a.i.1.6. Upgrades.  To use Software provided by Fusion-io as an upgrade, update, or supplement (collectively “Upgrade”), you must first be licensed for the original Software identified by Fusion-io as eligible for the Upgrade. To the extent the Upgrade supersedes the original Software, you may no longer use such Software. This EULA applies to each Upgrade unless Fusion-io provides other terms with the Upgrade. In case of a conflict between this EULA and such other terms, the other terms will prevail.

1.a.i.1.7. Consent to Use of Data.  Fusion-io may collect technical information relating to your use of the Software and Fusion-io products. You grant Fusion-io and its contractors a perpetual, irrevocable right to use and disclose non-identifiable information relating to your use of the Software and Fusion-io products, as long as any disclosed information does not include a key or other mechanism that would enable the information to be re-identified.

1.a.i.1.8. Audit.  You agree that Fusion-io may audit your use of the Software for compliance with these terms at any time, upon reasonable notice.  If such an audit reveals any use of the Software by you other than in full compliance with the terms of this EULA, you will reimburse Fusion-io for all reasonable expenses related to such audit in addition to any other liabilities you may incur as a result of such non-compliance.

1.a.i.1.9. Termination.  This EULA will be effective upon installation of the Software and will terminate upon the earlier of:  (a) your failure to comply with any term of this EULA; or (b) your return, destruction, or deletion of all instances and copies of the Software in your possession.  Upon termination of this EULA, at Fusion-io’s request, you will certify in writing to Fusion-io that all instances and copies of the Software, or any portion thereof, have either been returned to Fusion-io or otherwise destroyed or deleted from any of your computers or storage devices.  Fusion-io’s rights and your obligations will survive the termination of this EULA.

1.a.i.1.10.  Limitation of Liability.
